# Project Paranoid

## Overview

**Paranoid** project checks for well known weaknesses on cryptographic artifacts
such as public keys, digital signatures and general pseudorandom numbers.

The library contains implementations and optimizations of existing work found in
the literature that performed checks on mass crypto artifacts and showed that in
some situations, the generation of such artifacts are questionable. Here are
just some examples:

    Kleinjung, and Christophe Wachter. (2012). **Ron was wrong, Whit is
    right**](https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/064);

## Goal

The goal is to increase the confidence in cryptography use cases inside and
outside Google.

When dealing with asymmetric encryption, crypto artifacts usually are:

1.  Generated by one of our own tools (e.g., at Google we use for example
    [boringssl](https://github.com/google/boringssl) or
    [tink](https://github.com/google/tink)); or,
2.  Generated by third party tools that we have access to (so these tools can
    be, for example, checked for vulnerabilities using
    [wycheproof](https://github.com/google/wycheproof)); or,
3.  **Generated by third party tools and/or hardware or software black boxes
    that we do not have access to.**

With Paranoid, any cryptographic artifact can be tested, but its primary
motivation is to detect the usage of weak third party hardware or software black
boxes. Hence, Paranoid can be used even if we are not able to inspect the source
code (situation 3. listed above).

The project aims to detect known vulnerabilities as well as unknown ones. E.g.,
it tries to identify vulnerabilities caused by programming errors or the use of
weak proprietary random number generators. Detecting new vulnerabilities is of
course much more difficult than detecting known ones. Such detections may
require large sets of artifacts or find weak ones only with a low probability.

Therefore, we are very interested to receive feedback and learn about the
cryptographic library that generated weak cryptographic artifacts. The project
is constantly work in progress. After learning about weak implementations the
plan is to analyze and add detections targeting them.

## Getting Started

Documentation for the current implemented checks is located at [docs](docs). The
documentation will be populated with more content over time.

To learn how to use the checks, you can look at the [examples](examples)
folder or the unit tests (\*test.py files). The examples demonstrate testing
different crypto artifacts.

###  Installation

Clone the repository:

```$ git clone https://github.com/google/paranoid_crypto.git && cd paranoid_crypto```

**NOTE**: The commands below have been tested on Debian latest stable version
(bullseye). Make sure you will be using `python3.9` or newer.

Install dependencies:

```$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-pybind11 python3-fpylll libgmp-dev protobuf-compiler```

Install paranoid_crypto python package:

```$ python3 -m pip install .```

To check whether the installation was successful, you can run the unit tests.
For example:

```
$ cd paranoid_crypto && python3 -m unittest discover -b -p "*test.py"
.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 305 tests in 314.660s

OK
```

### Docker

Alternatively, if you want to run it in a container, you can use our provided
[Dockerfile](Dockerfile) as shown below.

**NOTE**: Make sure you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
installed.

After cloning the repository, build the docker image:

```$ docker build -t paranoid-img .```

Create and start the container:

```
$ docker run --name paranoid-container -it paranoid-img
paranoid-user@6191368b26b8:~$
```

To check whether the installation was successful, you can run the unit tests.
For example:

```
paranoid-user@6191368b26b8:~$ cd paranoid_crypto && python3 -m unittest discover -b -p "*test.py"
.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 305 tests in 307.555s

OK
```
